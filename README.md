### Redesign Approach

As part of the redesign task for the **"Choose Your Skip Size"** page, I followed a systematic approach to enhance both usability and visual appeal. Below is a summary of the key steps and decisions taken during the redesign process:

---

#### Problem Identification

* Reviewed the existing UI and identified key usability and visual issues.
* Found that:

  * Important details (like VAT, heavy waste allowance) were **missing** in the skip cards.
  * The dark theme used too many similar dark shades, making **text readability poor** and visual separation between elements unclear.

---

#### Visual & Theming Improvements

* Rebalanced the dark theme by introducing **lighter background grays** and better **contrast for texts, buttons, and cards**.
* Introduced **interactive feedback** (animation, hover, selected state, and glowing borders) to guide user actions visually.
* Ensured all icons and labels were **clearly visible** and consistent across all cards.

---

#### Theme Toggle Feature

* Added a **Light/Dark theme switcher** so you can preview both themes based on preference.
* Carefully ensured visual consistency and readability across both themes.

---

#### Summary of Enhancements

* Improved accessibility and readability with clearer typography and spacing.
* Enhanced visual hierarchy for skip cards using size badges, restriction tags, and pricing breakdowns.
* Made hidden cost details like VAT, transport cost, and heavy waste allowance **visible inside the card and footer summary**.
* Created a responsive, modern layout with soft card shadows, hover states, and smooth interactions.
